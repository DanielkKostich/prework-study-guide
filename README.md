## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This is my first coding project. I've been interested in coding for awhile and I am excited to get things rolling. My motivation for building this web app was so i could learn the basics  of coding. I built this to have a place to organize and store my notes in, from my coding bootcamp class. This app will keep me organized and familiar with GIT workflow. I've learned so much along the way so far, like GIT work flow , CSS, HTML, Markdown, and JavaScript basics.
